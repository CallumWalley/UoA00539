Computational load of fractal analysis algorithms applied to larger windows of EEG data is exponential. To answer the experimental question it is necessary to increase the window to a limit from which a strange attractor and fractal dimension can be calculated. Workflow parallelisation may be optimised with OpenMPI or MPI to process raw data files on Matlab running each fractal dimension algorithm in parallel. We are interested in assistance optimising the algorithms, R/W I/O performance, co-processor offloading, improving workflow pipeline and potentially "Mexing" which would vastly increase processing efficiency but require Matlab to "C" translation and compiling - BUT ONLY IF OTHER SOLUTIONS ARE INSUFFICIENT AND "Mexing" does not delay the project substantially.

Objective of the experiment is to generate accurate fractal and other complexity measures for comparison and to generate plots of data trajectory orbits to trace the strange attractors in 3 dimensions. Outcome would be a reliable and validated procedure to differentiate autistic adults from controls.

Benefits are to improve current behavioral diagnostic procedure by including a reliable biomarker to replace the existing taxonomy applied to autism spectrum disorder with a more reliable and valid measure. THe benefit to New Zealand and the world would be the reduction of false diagnoses and under-diagnoses of autism to more accurately identify and treat the largest and fastest growing childhood psychiatric disorder which may soon become the leading disorder of all types world-wide.
